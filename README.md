## Library Projects

### AndroidTools

The project expects a github repository called AndroidTools to be cloned in the workspace. To get a copy of the library in to Eclipse choose "Import" > "Projects from Git". From here, clone the repository with the following URI:
	
	https://github.com/chris-allen/android-tools.git

Select "Import existing projects" then hit "Next". There are two projects you
can import. You only need the one named "AndroidTools".
